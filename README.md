Wikipedia typically uses [sans-serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Typography) font, blue links are colored in [#0645AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link_color). While the stickersheet file contains a set of different sized stickers (dpi 720; sticker sizes: 300x40mm, 156x21mm, 100x15mm and 62x11mm) and can be ordered as a sheet, the single sticker file can be resized individually (dpi: 720; size 100x15mm).

Regarding the license: I am not sure if CC0 can even apply since the level of creation is quite low. Yet I added CC0 to make it explicit, that you can use and modify it however you like (see license). :)
