Wikipedia typically uses [sans-serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Typography) font, blue links are colored in [#0645AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link_color). While the stickersheet file contains a set of different sized stickers (dpi 720; sticker sizes: 300x40mm, 156x21mm, 100x15mm and 62x11mm) and can be ordered as a sheet, the single sticker file can be resized individually (dpi: 720; size 100x15mm).

Regarding the license: I'm not sure if CC0 is applicable at all, as the level of creation is quite low. Nevertheless, I added CC0 to make it clear that you can use and change it as you like (see license).
